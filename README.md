# Rust Guess Game 🧠🎯

A simple number guessing game implemented in Rust. This project is a beginner-friendly application that demonstrates basic Rust concepts such as user input handling, random number generation, and control flow. It’s inspired by the classic guessing game example from *The Rust Programming Language* tutorial. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Overview

This is a command-line game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player finds the right number. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Features
